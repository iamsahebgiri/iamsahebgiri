React has always been the de facto choice for building single page applications. React doesnâ€™t update the dom by itself. It uses React DOM for accomplishing it. Similarly there is no one solution for managing state or handling routes unlike Vue JS. Which is a good thing also a bad thing depending upon how you see it.

When it comes to client side routing, react router dom comes to mind. Thanks to [Ryan Florence](https://github.com/ryanflorence), [Michael Jackson](https://github.com/mjackson) and teams for building such a library. What most people forget is that there exists other client side routing solutions in the react ecosystem. For example -

- molefrog/wouter: ðŸ¥¢ A minimalist-friendly ~1.5KB routing for React and Preact. Nothing else but HOOKS.
- krasimir/navigo: A simple vanilla JavaScript router.
- franciscop/crossroad: A React library to handle navigation in your webapp.

So I thought of building a simple react routing library by myself as a challenge to dig deeper and to learn the internals.

I tried to mimic React Router's best practices by providing familiar Route and Link components.

Create a `lib/router.js` file which will contain all our routing logic. Import `useState` and `useEffect` from react.

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
```

Letâ€™s first create a navigate function that will manipulate the browserâ€™s history and then I will explain what it does.

```js
export const navigate = (href) => {
  window.history.pushState({}, '', href);

  const navEvent = new PopStateEvent('popstate');
  window.dispatchEvent(navEvent);
};
```

The `window.history.pushState()` method adds an entry to the browser's session history stack. It takes three arguments i.e. `state`, `unused` and `url`.

State is a javascript object that contains a copy of the history entry's state object. Unused is there for historical reasons, an empty string wonâ€™t hurt. The third parameter takes a url string of the same origin that you want to navigate to. Calling `pushState()` is similar to setting `window.location = "#foo"`, in that both will create and activate another history entry.

Now `Link` is one of the components that you use most frequently instead of `a` tag. It uses `a` tag behind the scenes.

```js
export const Link = ({ className, href, children }) => {
  const onClick = (e) => {
    if (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) return;
    e.preventDefault();
    navigate(href);
  };
  return (
    <a className={className} href={href} onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </a>
  );
};
```

`ctrl/cmd` + click on a link opens in new tab. Since react is a single page application we do noting. On the other hand, at first we prevent the default behavior of link by calling `preventDefault` on event object e. And then we call the navigate function manually.

The big elephant in the room is Router component.

```js
const Router = ({ routes, defaultComponent }) => {
  const [currentPath, setCurrentPath] = useState(window.location.pathname);

  useEffect(() => {
    const onLocationChange = () => {
      setCurrentPath(window.location.pathname);
    };

    window.addEventListener('popstate', onLocationChange);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('popstate', onLocationChange);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    routes.find(({ path }) => currentPath == path)?.component ||
    defaultComponent
  );
};
```

Router takes routes and defaultComponent. When there is a change in URL by Router returns the required component or else return the default component if it doesnâ€™t match with any listed components. We also have a clean up function in the useEffect the remove the event listener on unmount of the Router component.

### Usage

```js
import React from 'react';
import Router, { Link } from './lib/router';
import Counter from './components/Counter';
import Hello from './components/Hello';
import './style.css';

const NotFound = () => {
  return <h1> 404! Not found</h1>;
};

export default function App() {
  const routes = [
    {
      path: '/hello',
      component: <Hello />
    },
    {
      path: '/counter',
      component: <Counter />
    }
  ];
  const defaultComponent = <NotFound />;
  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link href="/counter">Counter</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link href="/hello">Hello</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <Router routes={routes} defaultComponent={defaultComponent} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
