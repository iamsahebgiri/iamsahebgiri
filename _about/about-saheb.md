I am an 18 years old developer and a student. I am passionate about technology, business and startup. People usually brag about themselves in blogs but I will try to keep everything genuine and authentic.

My journey is a little different then usual.

I started touching the computer when I entered class 5, yes that's right. Prior to that I have never seen a computer. I had been reading in the government school and there was no facility of computers back in those days. I didn't start with those I/O devices and fancy patterns in LOGO.

I started learning WebStack(HTML,JS,CSS) in class 5 and urged my parents to buy me a laptop. This was the time when I went to an English medium School, which I consider turning point of my life. I didn't know what exactly will happen with me but I was sure of the fact that something good is going to happen down the road.

I started my journey as a tech enthusiasts and find internet technology pretty interesting back in 2014. And the marquee tag is fascinating though deprecated now. Since then I have constantly learned new things every now and then.

I started reading Java books while I was in class 7. I find the book interesting and build a couple of android applications before class 10. Before 10 I have learnt C++, Java, Android Development, HTML, CSS and Javascript(JQuery). I also learned graphics design and edited a couple of photos in Photoshop. You can check my social handle for that.

After the tenth examination when results were yet to come when most people were busy finding their college I was learning Laravel, Vue, React. Eventually I ended up getting a college which was worse than I thought. However, 12th was not that bad either. I passed with good percentage in boards but I could not make it to elite IIT. 

Now I'm in Siksha O Anusandhan, doing my Btech CS. And waiting for college to reopen. By the time, I am doing cp and when got bored switching back to dev.
