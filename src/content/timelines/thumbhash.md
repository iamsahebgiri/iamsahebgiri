I initially explored using **BlurHash** in Skia but discovered a more efficient alternative called **ThumbHash**. It was created by Evan Wallace, the co-founder of Figma (who also developed esbuild).

I've implemented ThumbHash in a Skia-based image component, and it works great. However, Skia isn't a requirementâ€”you can also use it with React Native Image or **expo-image** for similar results.
