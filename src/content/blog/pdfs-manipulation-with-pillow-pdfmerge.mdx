If you work with computers(which I do most of the time) and have people around you, it is possible that they will ask you for favour.

I was no exception. I had been constantly pestered for creating documents, pdf, dtp and all these stuff. And I kind of like that but again excess of doing it makes me feel sick.

Now it is during COVID-19 pandemic, my cousin had her projects to be done before deadlines.I did most of the things like creating documents and all these stuff.

Like all other projects it contains the same shit like acknowledgement, contents, blah blah blah! She asked me to start the page number from chapter one and I have merged all the things into one docs file. But I didn't know how to start the page number from a different page other than the starting page. And I was too lazy to google it.

> Create pdf from multiple docs file and images.

How did I solve the problem in a different way?

I have created two pdfs i.e. Original text and Index page including all other pages.

Now all I did was add the page not only on original text and saved it as PDF in Word. Simple enough?

I repeated the same with another PDF but without page no because she said so to me so.

I have the picture of the front page in png format. I had to transform it into pdf as well. This time I didn’t use MS Word but the Python package Pillow.

## Fun part begins

I had to merge all the pdfs into one and convert png to pdf.

**Steps to convert png to pdf in Python**

1. Install Pillow

```python
pip install pillow
```

2. Write code and run

```python
from PIL import Image
frontPageImg = Image.open(r'./1.png')
frontPage = frontPageImg.convert('RGB')
frontPage.save(r'./front_page.pdf')
```

Finally I have my `front_page.pdf` done to rock.

**Steps to merge all the pdf into single pdf in Javascript(Nodejs)**

This time I choose Nodejs to get shit done quickly.
Here are the steps…

Create a folder say, `pdf_work`

```js
npm init –y
```

```js
npm install pdfmerge
```

And write the code as below.

```js
let PDFMerge = require('pdfmerge');

PDFMerge(
  ['./front_page.pdf', './acknowlege.pdf', './original_text.pdf'],
  'output.pdf',
)
  .then((done) => {
    console.log(done); // success
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.error(error.code); // Logs error code if an error occurs
  });
```

And voila! We are good to go.
